1.  Idea
    - Simple webshop
    - Outdoor

2.  Back-end
    Node.js (Express.js)

✅ Great for quick development and integrates well with React.
✅ Has a huge ecosystem for testing (Jest, Supertest).
✅ Good for REST and GraphQL APIs.
⚠️ Not the best for CPU-heavy tasks.
PHP (Symfony or Laravel)

✅ Well-structured and widely used for e-commerce.
✅ Built-in testing tools (PHPUnit, Behat).
✅ Easy to set up an admin panel if needed.
⚠️ Can be a bit verbose compared to Node.js.
Python (FastAPI or Django)

✅ FastAPI is lightweight, async-friendly, and great for APIs.
✅ Django has built-in admin features for easy management.
✅ Pytest is great for testing.
⚠️ FastAPI is newer, so it has less community support than Django.
C# (.NET Core)

✅ Highly scalable and robust.
✅ Strong type safety and excellent testing tools (xUnit, NUnit).
✅ Good for long-term maintainability.
⚠️ Heavier setup compared to Node.js.
Best Choice?
If you want speed & simplicity → Node.js + Express.js
If you’re comfortable with PHP → Symfony or Laravel
If you like Python → FastAPI
If you want enterprise-level stability → C# .NET Core
